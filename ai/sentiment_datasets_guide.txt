Getting started with Sentiment Datasets
Tips for getting started with Sentiment Datasets:
Sentiment represents the aggregate market mood about stocks.
Rising stock price is characterized by positive or "bullish" sentiment, while a declining stock price is characterized by negative or "bearish" sentiment.
The intensity of sentiment represents the strength of the sentiment.
A high intensity of sentiment, regardless of the mood or direction, exists when strong market moves occur.
For example, positive market sentiment combined with high intensity is typically a characteristic of strong bullish moves in prices.
Sentiment data can help us better predict market behavior and improve our forecasting, not only for price direction but also for volatility and volume traded.
Sentiment data have data fields of sentiment scores of an event. Unlike fundamental data, these data naturally have high frequencies, which leads to high turnovers in an Alpha.
To achieve reasonable margin rates, you are advised to use the following operations: hump_decay, ts_decay_linear, and ts_decay_exp_window. But you should be careful with the usage of lookback days greater than 63 (i.e., one quarter) as older events may have no impact.
Data may be based on information from newspapers, news websites, Facebook, Twitter, blog posts, discussion groups, and forums.
Social sentiment indicators help investors identify information in social media that could cause a stock's price to increase or decrease in the near future. They also help businesses understand how they may be performing in the eyes of their consumers.
Example Alpha Ideas:

Long/short stocks with positive/negative sentiment, filtering out days and stocks with low sentiment volume.
Use sentiment volume as a proxy for the market's attention towards a stock. This could be used directly as a stock returns predictor or a condition in trade_when.
